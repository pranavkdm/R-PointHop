# R-PointHop: A Green and High Performance Point Cloud Registration Method

R-PointHop is an unsupervised learning based method for registration of 3D point cloud objcets. This is an official implementation of R-PointHop by [Pranav Kadam](https://github.com/pranavkdm), [Min Zhang](https://github.com/minzhang-1), Shan Liu and C.-C. Jay Kuo. This work was carried out at Media Communications Lab (MCL), University of Southern California, USA.

## Introduction

In this work, we introdcue R-PointHop, an improved version of our previous work on point cloud registration named Salient Points Analysis (SPA). The SPA paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9301874).
